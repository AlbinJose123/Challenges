# Challenges
Challenge 1: Square Numbers and Return Their Sum
Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks:

Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.

Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.

Sample properties 1, 3, 5

Sample method output 35

Challenge 2: Implement a Calculator Class

Problem statement Write a Python class called Calculator by completing the tasks below:

Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Initializer

Implement an initializer to initialize the values of num1 and num2. Properties

â€¢ num1
â€¢ num2

Task 2

ðŸ‘‰ Methods

â€¢ add() is a method that returns the sum of num1 and num2.
â€¢ subtract() is a method that returns the subtraction of num1 from num2.
â€¢ multiply() is a method that returns the product of num1 and num2.
â€¢ divide() is a method that returns the division of num2 by num1.

Input - Pass numbers (integers or floats) in the initializer.

Output - addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

Sample input

obj = Calculator(10, 94)
obj.add()
obj.subtract()
obj.multiply()
obj.divide()

Challenge 3: Implement the Complete Student Class

Problem statement

Implement the complete Student class by completing the tasks below

Task

ðŸ‘‰ Implement the following properties as private:

â€¢ name
â€¢ rollNumber

ðŸ‘‰ Include the following methods to get and set the private properties above:

â€¢ getName()
â€¢ setName()
â€¢ getRollNumber()
â€¢ setRollNumber()

ðŸ‘‰ Implement this class according to the rules of encapsulation.

Challenge 4: Implement a Banking Account

Problem statement

Implement the basic structure of a parent class, Account, and a child class, SavingsAccount.

Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.

Account has the following properties:

    â€¢ title
    â€¢ Balance

SavingsAccount has the following properties:

    â€¢ interestRate

Task 2

Create an initializer for Account class. The order of parameters should be the following, where Ashish is the title, and 5000 is the account balance:

Account("Ashish", 5000)

Task 3

Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.

Create an initializer for the SavingsAccount class using the initializer of the Account class in the order below:

Account("Ashish", 5000, 5)

Here, Ashish is the title and 5000 is the balance and 5 is the interestRate.

Input - Checking all the properties and methods

Output - Expecting perfectly defined fields and getter/setters

Note: Do not use initializers to initialize the properties. Use the set methods to do so.

If the setter is not defined properly, the corresponding getter will also generate an error even if the getter is defined properly.

Challenge 5: Handling a Bank Account

Problem statement

In this challenge, we will be extending the previous challenge and implementing methods in the parent class and its corresponding child class.

The initializers for both classes have been defined for you.

Task 1

In the Account class, implement the getBalance() method that returns balance.

Task 2

In the Account class, implement the deposit(amount) method that adds amount to the balance.

It does not return anything.

Sample input

balance = 2000
deposit(500)
getbalance()

Sample output

2500

Task 3

In the Account class, implement the withdrawal(amount) method that subtracts the amount from the balance.

It does not return anything.

Sample input

balance = 2000
withdrawal(500)
getbalance()

Sample output

1500

Task 4

In the SavingsAccount class, implement an interestAmount() method that returns the interest amount of the current balance.

Below is the formula for calculating the interest amount:

image1

Sample input

balance = 2000
interestRate = 5
interestAmount()

Sample output

100
